# Lessons (in order):
 * [getting started](getting-started/README.md) - python interpreter & installing python, git, and a text editor
 * [printing and arithmetic](basics/README.md)
 * [variables & `raw_input()`](variables/README.md) - get input from the user, use text and numbers stored as variables
 * [types](types/README.md) - learn about integers, floats, strings, and converting between types
 * [conditionals & booleans](logic/README.md) - learn about if/else/elif, booleans, boolean logic, and comparing values
 * [software engineering & debugging](debugging/README.md)
 * [lists](lists/README.md) - a new kind of variable: lists of variables! These are **not** the same as arrays.
 * [loops](loops/README.md) - want to know how to make something repeat over and over? Click [here](https://nathansolomon1678.github.io/programmer-training/general/lessons/funny-joke-about-loops/README.md)!
 * [functions](functions/README.md) - chunks of code that you can repeat at any point in one line, and can work like math functions (like `f(x)`)
 * [DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself](dry/README.md) - become a good programmer by not unnecessarily repeating code. Sorry if this lesson is a bit dry.
 * [classes](classes/README.md) - **Q:** Who doesn't like object-oriented programming? **A:** lot's of people
 * [modules](modules/README.md) - use code from other files and helpful code that other people have made for you
 * [git & github](git/README.md) - version-control system, for collaborating on projects. No, it's not like google drive. Git is difficult until you get the hang of it.
