# Programmer Training

This is designed for FRC team 1678, but anyone is welcome to use it to learn about:
 * python
 * c++
 * and more stuff

### How the training is structured for our team
**[General](nathansolomon1678.github.io/programmer-training/general):** This is where you start your basic python training. After a few months, join either app or robot programming.
**[Robot](nathansolomon1678.github.io/programmer-training/robot):** This is the subteam that programs the robot. This involves programming autonomous routines, controllers, tests, computer vision (sometimes).
**[App](nathansolomon1678.github.io/programmer-training/app):** this is the subteam that creates and runs the scouting app. That includes doing calculations with the server (python), making the app for tablets (swift), and managing the database.
